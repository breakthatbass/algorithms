# Algorithms: Fourth Edition
### by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne

This repo holds my solutions to the exercises in the book.  

The book provides a library called [algos4](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) to make certain things simpler to spend less time on syntax and more time on the theory behind the data structures and algorithms. However, I try to use the library sparingly because another goal of mine was to learn Java.

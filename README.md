# Algorithms: Fourth Edition
### by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne

This repo holds my solutions to the exercises in the book.  
*in progress...*

[algs4 library](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) - lib installation info on this page  
[algs4 docs](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/) - lib documentation

When using any of the libs:  
compile: `javac-algs4 file.java`  
run: `java-algs4 file`  

As far as I know, the answers are right. If you see any that are wrong feel free to open an issue or pull request.

filtering

which of the following require saving all the values from standard input (in an
array, say), and which could be implmented as a filter using only a fixed number
of variables and arrays of fixed size (not dependent on n)?

for each, the input comes from standard input and consists of n real numbers
between 0 and 1.

- print the maximum and minimum numbers -> can be a filter
- print the median of the numbers -> must be saved (not filter)
- print the kth smallest value, for k less than 100 -> can be saved in an array
  of k size (filter)
- print the sum of the squares of the numbers -> can be a filter
- print the average of the n numbers -> must be saved
- print the percentages of numbers greater than the average -> must be saved
- print the n numbers in increading order -> must be saved
- print the n numbers in random order -> must be saved

/*
 * what (if anything) is wrong with each of the following statement?
 *
 * a. if (a > b) then c = 0;			'then' shouldn't be there.
 * b. if a > b { c = 0; }				'a > b' needs to be in parentheses
 * c. if (a > b) c = 0;					this is correct syntax
 * d. if (a > b) c = 0 else b = 0;	there is a missing semicolon after 'c = 0'
